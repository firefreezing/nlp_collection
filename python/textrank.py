text1 = """The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, an international football \
tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA once \
every four years. It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018. It was the \
first World Cup to be held in Eastern Europe, and the 11th time that it had been \
held in Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup. \
It was also the first World Cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system. \
The finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, \
while the host nation qualified automatically. Of the 32 teams, 20 had also appeared in \
the previous tournament in 2014, while both Iceland and Panama made their first appearances \
at a FIFA World Cup. A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. \
The final took place on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, between France and Croatia. \
France won the match 4â€“2 to claim their second World Cup title, marking the fourth consecutive \
title won by a European team."""
